    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This artifact focuses on designing and defining the structure, objectives, and behavior of an AI assistant. 
      It outlines the principles of intelligent system design including defining goals, interaction rules, data usage, and success measures.
    </p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
      The goal of this lab is to conceptualize an AI assistant that can perform specific tasks such as booking travel, providing customer support, or aiding users with everyday actions — while maintaining clear boundaries, tone, and workflows.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Components</h2>

    <h3>1. Bot Objective</h3>
    <p>
      The assistant’s main goal defines what it aims to achieve — for instance, assisting users in booking travel, offering customer service, or helping with routine tasks. 
      A well-defined objective guides its features, functionality, and data flow.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Knowledge Base</h3>
    <p>
      The assistant’s intelligence is determined by its data sources. 
      For example, a travel assistant would rely on databases containing destinations, prices, flight schedules, and user preferences. 
      The quality and structure of this data directly influence response accuracy and relevance.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Limitations</h3>
    <p>
      It’s essential to define what the assistant should <strong>not</strong> do. 
      For example, a travel assistant might not handle payments or access sensitive financial information to ensure security and compliance.
    </p>

    <h3>4. User Engagement</h3>
    <p>
      Engagement style defines how the assistant interacts with users — whether formal, conversational, or casual. 
      It can be proactive (offering help) or reactive (responding to input), depending on design goals.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Media and Data Integration</h3>
    <p>
      Some assistants integrate images, charts, or maps to improve user experience. 
      For example, a travel assistant could display destination photos or weather visualizations to enhance interaction.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Interaction Initiation</h3>
    <p>
      The assistant’s initial interaction sets the tone — typically starting with a greeting such as “Hello! How can I assist you today?” to build a friendly, engaging experience.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Workflow and Steps</h3>
    <p>
      Defining step-by-step actions ensures logical task flow. 
      For instance, in booking a flight, the assistant might follow this sequence: 
      <em>Collect user preferences → Display options → Validate selections → Confirm booking.</em>
    </p>

    <h3>8. Conclusion and Actions</h3>
    <p>
      Once enough information is gathered, the assistant concludes by confirming actions or suggesting next steps. 
      For example, after confirming a reservation, it may provide follow-up options or a summary.
    </p>

    <h3>9. Measuring Success</h3>
    <p>
      A successful interaction means the user’s problem is solved effectively and efficiently. 
      User satisfaction, task completion, and interaction fluidity are key metrics of success.
    </p>

    <h3>10. Testing Scenarios</h3>
    <p>
      Testing involves simulating real-world interactions to ensure the assistant behaves according to design parameters. 
      For instance, testing a flight-booking scenario validates that all steps — search, confirmation, and booking — occur smoothly and accurately.
    </p>

    <h2>Value Proposition</h2>
    <p>
      This artifact demonstrates a structured approach to designing intelligent systems, emphasizing user-centered design, data ethics, and efficient automation. 
      The framework developed here can be applied to AI-driven solutions in various industries including customer service, education, and business analytics.
